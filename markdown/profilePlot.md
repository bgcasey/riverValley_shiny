### Cross-section along the N. Saskatchewan

Variable profiles along two cross-section lines, north and south of the N. Saskatchewan river in the N. Saskatchewan Central region of the Ribbon of Green. The lines follow paths through Edmonton's trail network to present the features a person could expect to encounter as they walk through Edmontonâ€™s river valley. Lines pass through summer terrestrial pinch-points.
